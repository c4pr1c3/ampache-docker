## Usage

To run official builds from docker hub you can run these commands:

To run the current Ampache master (stable) branch
```bash
docker run --name=ampache -d -v /path/to/your/music:/media:ro -p 80:80 ampache/ampache
```

To run the current Ampache develop branch
```bash
docker run --name=ampache -d -v /path/to/your/music:/media:ro -p 80:80 ampache/ampache:develop
```

The develop tag is set up to use git updates so you don't have to rebuild your images to stay up to date with development.

## Running on ARM

The automated builds for the official repo are now built for linux/amd64, linux/arm/v7 and linux/arm64.
